I am a 1-st year student in Computer Science at the University of Washington, Seattle, Before that, I was at the Lakeside School in Seattle, where I was fortunate to be advised by Erik Christensen. In the past, I spent time playing soccer and coding.

**Research Interests**: My current research interests are **interactive and data-centric AI/ML** with an emphasis on **faithful evaluation** and **effort-light approaches** with applications in chemistry, biology, physics, etc. My past explorations lay at the intersection of machine learning, data mining, and natural language processing.
