Studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington, Seattle.

**Research Interests**: My current research interests are **interactive and data-centric AI/ML** with an emphasis on **faithful evaluation** and **effort-light approaches** with applications in chemistry, biology, physics, etc. My past explorations lay at the intersection of machine learning, data mining, and natural language processing.
