### Autumn 2023 reflection:
This quarter has been filled with both positive and negative meaningful experiences: meeting new people, scoring soccer goals, debugging code, reviewing for midterms, and so on. I've learned many things from these experiences: be open minded, don't hesitate, practice the week before the test. I think the overall lesson I learned from these experiences can be best summarized in one sentence: you live and you learn. This idea of constantly continuing, persevering, learning from past mistakes and moving on from them to be a better person tomorrow is a powerful phrase that my friend used to say whenever we did bad at something. All of my experiences in this first autumn quarter at the UW has taught me these important lessons and I will do my best to apply them in the following quarters at the UW and achieve my goals.
